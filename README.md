    🔹 HTML – CSS
    🔹 PHP
    🔹 JS
    🔹 MySQL

# Additional Information ℹ
You are probably wondering how this platform was designed? What methods, technologies and languages are used? So "BANQUE DU PEUPLE" is a very compact project.

✔ **25 JS / JQUERY FUNCTIONS
    
    In order to manage the controls and the dynamic data transfer and the loading on single page, it was necessary to use a lot of JS (AJAX, JQUERY) but all while using the least possible code.

 
✔ **01 FrameWork : BOOTSTRAP (Mixed with Material Design)
    
    Being a very big fan of Bootstrap I did not prevent myself from peeling it thoroughly in this project by mixing it with Material Design. The result is really very satisfactory.

 
✔ **00 TEMPLATES & PHP MANAGEMENT (MVC)
    
    All Pages as well as the design were coded by the same single person and without outside help.
    The whole project is managed by PHP and based on the Method [MODEL - VIEW - CONTROLLER].
