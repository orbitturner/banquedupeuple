# ü§î What is it ? / What's the point? ü§î
¬´ LA BANQUE DU PEUPLE ¬ª is an online banking management platform. It is a class project proposed by the Professor for the LP-GL class at ISI during the year 2019/2020 and used to improve knowledge of TW and DBMS.

# Additional Information ‚Ñπ
You are probably wondering how this platform was designed? What methods, technologies and languages are used? So "BANQUE DU PEUPLE" is a very compact project.

‚úî **25 JS / JQUERY FUNCTIONS
    In order to manage the controls and the dynamic data transfer and the loading on single page, it was necessary to use a lot of JS (AJAX, JQUERY) but all while using the least possible code.
    
‚úî **01 FrameWork : BOOTSTRAP (Mixed with Material Design)
    > Being a very big fan of Bootstrap I did not prevent myself from peeling it thoroughly in this project by mixing it with Material  Design. The result is really very satisfactory.
    
‚úî **00 TEMPLATES & PHP MANAGEMENT (MVC)
> All Pages as well as the design were coded by the same single person and without outside help.
> The whole project is managed by PHP and based on the Method [MODEL - VIEW - CONTROLLER].
